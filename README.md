# dns_tracker

This will be a small project to test some dns crawling to build a dependency tree between different entities.
It may also be useful to identify associated domains

## Starting Point

Input: IP/DNS

Based on the IP or DNS the specific crawling function is going to be started and will run to a specific level,
which needs to be defined before running the script.

## Output

Web/SVG Graph!
